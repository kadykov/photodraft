# Cline Rules: Photodraft Project

**Version:** 0.1.2 (Reflects creator/copyright, title/desc fixes, schema publishing, debug command)
**Date:** 2025-06-02

## 1. Core Project Understanding

*   **Purpose:** This project (`photodraft`) is a Python script that generates a JSON manifest (`image_manifest.json`) from a directory of photos. This manifest is intended for use by an AstroJS personal website to display images.
*   **Key Workflow:** Photos exported (e.g., from Darktable) -> `generate_manifest.py` runs -> `image_manifest.json` updated -> AstroJS site builds using the manifest.
*   **Technology Stack:** Python, Pillow, `uv` for dependency management, `just` for tasks, Ruff for linting/formatting, MyPy for type checking.

## 2. Memory Bank Management

*   **Structure:** The Memory Bank consists of core Markdown files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`. This `.clinerules.md` file is also part of it.
*   **Updates:** The Memory Bank MUST be updated when:
    1.  Discovering new project patterns.
    2.  After implementing significant changes (like the recent addition of creator/copyright, title/description fixes, schema publishing, and debug command).
    3.  When the user explicitly requests with "**update memory bank**" (requires reviewing ALL files).
    4.  When context needs clarification.
*   **Priority Files for Updates:** `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` are critical for tracking current state and should be updated frequently.
*   **My Reset:** I must remember that my memory resets between sessions. The Memory Bank is my SOLE source of truth. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task.

## 3. Tool Usage & Workflow Preferences

*   **File Paths:** The project uses `/mnt/Web` as a default `PHOTO_ROOT_DIR` and output location.
*   **Metadata Priority:** The script now has a defined prioritization for key fields:
    *   **Title:** XMP `dc:title` -> EXIF `ImageDescription` -> EXIF `ObjectName`.
    *   **Description:** XMP `dc:description` -> EXIF `UserComment` -> EXIF `ImageDescription` (if not used for title).
    *   **Tags:** XMP `dc:subject` -> EXIF `XPKeywords`.
    *   **Creator:** XMP `dc:creator` -> EXIF `Artist`.
    *   **Copyright:** XMP `dc:rights` -> EXIF `Copyright`.
*   **Schema Adherence:** All generated JSON must adhere to `image_manifest.schema.json`. The schema itself can now be published to the output directory.
*   **`just` for tasks:** Common operations are defined in the `justfile`.
    *   `just generate`: Runs the main script.
    *   `just publish-schema`: Copies the schema to the output.
    *   `just publish`: Runs `generate` then `publish-schema`.
    *   `debug-image <path>`: Useful for inspecting metadata of a single image.
*   **Error Reporting:** Script prints errors to stdout and skips problematic files.
*   **Idempotency:** `generate_manifest.py` is designed to be idempotent.
*   **`write_to_file` Fallback:** If `replace_in_file` fails multiple times for complex changes, use `write_to_file` with the full intended file content.

## 4. Identified Areas for Attention / Potential Improvements (from `progress.md`)

*   **`clean_exif_string`:** The function `value.replace("", "")` is a no-op. Verify if actual null character (`""`) removal is needed and implement correctly if so.
*   **Redundant Image Opening:** The script opens images twice in the main loop. This is a candidate for optimization.
*   **XMP Parsing Robustness:** While improved with helper functions for Bag, Seq, and Alt, continue to monitor for unhandled XMP structures.
*   **`isoSpeedRatings` Handling:** Schema allows array, script provides integer/None. Clarify or align.
*   **Future Enhancements (from README):**
    *   Pydantic integration.
    *   More robust error handling and logging.
    *   External configuration file.

## 5. Communication with User

*   When in PLAN MODE, use `plan_mode_respond` for communication.
*   When needing to switch to ACT MODE, explicitly ask the user to "toggle to Act mode".
*   Be direct and technical. Avoid conversational fluff.
*   Confirm actions taken and clearly state next steps.

*(This file will be updated as I learn more about the project and user preferences.)*
